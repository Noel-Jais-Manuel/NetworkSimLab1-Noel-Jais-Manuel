This repository contains my OSI Model and Wireshark Packet Analysis Lab for the ICTAK Networking Module. It includes explanations of all seven OSI layers, an OSI mnemonic, OSI vs TCP/IP comparison, PDU details, and short notes on MAC, IP, and Port addressing. The Wireshark practical section includes captured packets for HTTP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and ARP, with each screenshot showing the full breakdown of Layer 2, Layer 3, Layer 4, and application-level information. All screenshots are stored in the Screenshots folder, and the complete written work is compiled in the OSI_Wireshark_Report.pdf file inside the OSI_Wireshark_Lab directory.
